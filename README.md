#SocialNetwork #JavaFX #DesktopApp #UniversityProject

Welcome to the Social Network Desktop App, a comprehensive project built using JavaFX. 
This application marks a significant milestone as my first complex endeavor during university studies, an app that helped me learn new things about Java and put in practice most of the knowledge gained during advanced programming course.
Explore the features that facilitate social interactions, user profiles, and dynamic content. Dive into a user-friendly interface crafted with JavaFX, providing an engaging experience. 
This project showcases my journey in JavaFX development and my commitment to creating impactful desktop applications. Feel free to explore, contribute, and share your thoughts.
Thank you for being a part of this learning journey!
